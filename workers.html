								 In contrast to what you may think, the healthcare industry is fairly new. However, even though less than 200 years old, it has come a far way to what it is today. Healthcare began quality and sanitary check on the treatments and medicines given has now grown into 3D printing of organs and the ability to practice a surgery on a replica of a person's body before the big day and clinical trials being done from the comfort of one's home. It is an exciting field that is ever evolving and continuing to make changes for the better of human life. It is rewarding and fulfilling, as they do their part in helping save another individual's life.
								</br>
								
								The best thing about the healthcare industry is that one size does not fit all. There are positions and careers that require a wide range of education and experience. Some of these careers include the classic doctor, the nightingale nurses, pharmacists, dentists, physicians assistants, and much much more. Here at the MedCenter, we hope that the resources that we have provided below can help you gain better perspective into these fields and careers, as well as help you in your healthcare journey.
